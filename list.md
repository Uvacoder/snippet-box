**Implemented**

- [x] Login / logout / register
- [x] Auto login (token valid 14 days)
- [x] Roles (admin, user)

**Planned features**

- [ ] Guest access (read and search access to snippets marked as public)
- [ ] Generate token for raw snippet access
- [ ] Admin panel (right now admin and users share the same view)

By default, admin account is created with login `admin@local.com` and password `snippet-admin`. If there are any snippets in the database, they will be assigned to the admin as the owner.
